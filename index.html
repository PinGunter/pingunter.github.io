    <h2 id="1">Begginings with Vulkan</h2>
    <p>
      When I first started this project, 11 months ago, I had never used Vulkan
      before. I had worked a little with OpenGL but Vulkan is a whole beast of
      its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first started with the classic
      <a style="display: inline" href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/"
        >Vulkan Tutorial</a
      >. After days (and weeks) working on it, trying to understand every bit of
      it, I managed to get my first ever triangle in Vulkan.

    <p>A lot of time has passed since that moment but I'm still proud of it.</p>
    <p>
      Later I got to work with 3D models and some basic camera manipulation. At
      this point I was modifying the basic tutorial code to get to know it more.
      However I still did not understand it quite well.

      After that, I was kind of stuck. I didn't know how to organize the code
      and interacting directly with the API without any abstractions was
      difficult. Besides, one of my main goals with this project was to work
      with the <strong>Ray-Tracing</strong> Vulkan Extension, so I needed to
      start working on that.

    <p>
      A couple of months passed, where I was in a weird spot: I didn't really
      know how to proceed and didn't have the time either. I finally decided to
      take the Nvidia Ray-Tracing Tutorial for Vulkan. This allowed me to get to
      speed and actually grasp how Vulkan worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following this tutorial I was able to get my first rasterized and
      ray-traced scene.

    <p>
      I know had a base frame where I could work. I started adding things like
      <a href="https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo">ImGuizmo</a> (ImGui
      was already in the base project). And started to learn on how to
      manipulate transforms, when to rebuild the acceleration structures and
      things like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the graphics side of things, I added ray-traced shadows and
      reflections. Both of which were quite easy to implement given the nature
      of ray-tracing. This allowed me to have full-working mirrors in the scene.
      The difference between getting mirrors to work in ray-tracing vs
      rasterization is huge.
